        "Q1- **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - A programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\" which can contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures or methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2- **What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - A blueprint for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3- **What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - An instance of a class that consists of data and behavior defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5- **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Abstraction hides complex reality while showing only the necessary parts. Encapsulation hides the internal state of the object and protects it from unwanted changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6- **What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Special methods in Python with double underscores before and after the name, like __init__ and __str__, used to enable various functionalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7- **Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP**.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - A mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8- **What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The ability to present the same interface for different underlying data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9- **How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Achieved with private and protected access specifiers where private attributes are denoted with a single underscore _ and double underscore __.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The __init__ method used to initialize a newly created object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10- **What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Class methods take cls as the first parameter and can access class variables, whereas static methods do not have access to cls or self.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11- **What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Python does not support method overloading. Default arguments can achieve similar behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12- **What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Redefining a method in a derived class that is already defined in the base class.\n",

        "Q13- **What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",

        "Q14- **Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",

        "\n",
        "Q15- **What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - A class that cannot be instantiated and often contains abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16- **What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "\n",

        "Q18- **What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Class variables are shared across all instances, whereas instance variables are specific to each object.\n",

        "Q19- **Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - __str__ provides a human-readable string representation, whereas __repr__ provides an unambiguous string representation.\n",

        "Q22- **What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - @staticmethod does not access any properties of an instance or the class, whereas @classmethod can access class variables.\n",
